# Assignment: Web Store Content & Styling

## Overview

Complete the content and styling for `index.html` in this project. Your styling should include all necessary properties learned in class (or beyond) for text/fonts and basic layouts.

You will be styling a layout for only the smallest viewport. The page will be graded in Chrome (both browser AND "device" mode) with testing in viewport widths ranging between 320px (minimum) and 640px (maximum). The site must be well structured when tested within all viewport sizes in that range. Content should remain fluid and fill the entire width of the viewport.
